# CI/CD Pipeline Testing Guide

## **1. Trigger Pipeline Testing**

### **Step 1: Make a Test Commit**
```bash
# to push in order to trigger the pipeline for testing
echo "# Test commit for pipeline verification" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: testing CI/CD pipeline for verification"
git push origin develop
# then merge develop into main to trigger the deployment
```

### **Step 2: Monitor GitHub Actions**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Watch the `main.yml` workflow
4. Check each job completes successfully

## **2. Expected Pipeline Jobs & Success Criteria**

### **Security Scan Job**
- **Trivy vulnerability scanner** should run
- Results should appear in GitHub Security tab

### **Backend CI Job**
- ESLint passes
- npm audit completes (may show warnings - that's normal)
- Tests run with coverage
- Coverage report uploaded to Codecov

### **Frontend CI Job**
- ESLint passes
- npm audit completes
- Tests run with coverage
- Build succeeds
- Coverage report uploaded to Codecov

### **Container Security Job** (only on main/develop branches)
- Docker images build successfully
- Trivy scans container images
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### **Deploy Job** (only on main branch push)
- Images pushed to Docker Hub
- Deployment to Azure succeeds
- Health checks pass

## **3. Manual Verification Steps**

### **Check Security Results**
1. Go to GitHub repository → Security tab
2. Look for:
   - Code scanning alerts
   - Dependency review
   - Security advisories

### **Check Coverage Reports**
1. Go to Codecov.io (if connected)
2. Verify coverage reports for both backend and frontend

### **Check Deployment**
1. Visit your Azure Web App URLs
2. Verify applications are running
3. Check environment variables are set correctly

### **Check Monitoring Dashboard**
1. Deploy with Terraform: `cd terraform && terraform apply`
2. Get monitoring URL: `terraform output monitoring_url`
3. Access the monitoring dashboard
4. Verify real-time metrics are displayed

## **4. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **If Security Scan Fails:**
- Check if Trivy configuration is correct
- Review security scan logs for specific errors

### **If npm audit fails:**
- Review vulnerability reports
- Update dependencies if needed
- Consider using `npm audit --audit-level=high` for stricter checks

### **If Container Security fails:**
- Check Docker Hub credentials
- Verify image names and tags
- Review Trivy scan results

### **If Deployment fails:**
- Check Azure credentials
- Verify resource group and app names
- Review health check endpoints

### **If Terraform deployment fails:**
- Check Azure authentication: `az login`
- Verify resource group exists: `az group list`
- Check Terraform configuration syntax

## **5. Performance Monitoring**

### **Pipeline Execution Time**
- Monitor how long each job takes
- Optimize if jobs are taking too long

### **Resource Usage**
- Check GitHub Actions minutes usage
- Monitor Docker Hub storage usage

### **Test Security Endpoints**
```bash
curl -f https://your-backend.azurewebsites.net/api/health
```
